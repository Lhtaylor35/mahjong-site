                        Mahjong is a popular 4-player gambling game enjoyed all over the world. The basic premise and goal of the game is to create a winning hand, either by drawing the necessary tiles from the wall (basically the deck) or by claiming the discards of your opponents. There are various types of winning hands, with rarer hands being worth more "points" known as faan, which determines how much money the winner gets from the losers. There are many different regional variations of Mahjong, and while they all share the same basic premise, each one has its own set of rules and possible winning hands. This website will focus solely on Hong Kong style Mahjong, arguably the most popular variation played.                   
                    </p>
                    <h5 class="col">The Tiles</h5>
                    <p class="col-sm-9">
                        A Mahjong set consists of 144 tiles, with 4 copies of each tile. There are 3 suits with tiles numbered 1 through 9 of each suit. The suits are known as Dots, Bamboo, and Cracks (or characters, as they contain the Chinese characters for 1 through 9). There are 7 types of honor tiles; 4 of them consist of the Chinese character for East, South, West, and North, and the other 3 are known as the Red, Green, and White Dragons. All of the previously mentioned tiles have 4 copies each, however there are an additional 8 unique special tiles of which there is only 1 copy. These are the seasons and flowers, which are each numbered 1 through 4. Some variations of Mahjong don't use these flowers, but Hong Kong style does. See below for the full tiles list.  
                    </p>

                    <br />
                    <h5 class="col">Goal of the Game</h5>
                    <p class="col-sm-9">
                        The goal of the game is to create a hand consisting of 4 "melds" or sets, as well as a pair. There are 3 types of melds, which are called Chows (or straights), Pungs (three-of-a-kind), and Kungs (four-of-a-kind). A chow consists of 3 tiles of sequential numbers of the same suit. A pung consists of 3 of the same tile. A kung consists of 4 of the same tile. A winning hand must contain 4 of these melds as well as a pair of any tile. Therefore, a winning hand will usually contain 14 total tiles, but can be more if the player has any kungs. As soon as any player completes their hand, the game ends and the faan or point value of the winning hand is used to determine how much is paid to the winner. 
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="col" id="set-up">Set Up</h3>
                    <p class="col-sm-9">
                        The game begins with all the tiles face down on the table to be shuffled. This is done by simply having all players push the tiles around to mix them up. After shuffling, each player builds a wall containing 36 tiles by lining up 18 tiles and then stacking another layer on top of that. These walls are then brought together to create a square and will be drawn from later on.
                    </p>
                    <div class="col col-sm-8">
                    <img src="img/wall.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="wall" />

                    <h5 class="col">Rolling Dice and Winds</h5>
                    <p class="col-sm-9">
                        After the walls have been set up, one player will then roll 3 six-sided die. The player who rolls the die is considered the East Wind seat and will be the first to draw tiles as well as the first player to take their turn. Likewise, every other player will also be considered a certain wind seat. Going counter-clockwise, the second player is the South wind, the third player is the West wind, and the fourth player is the North wind. If a winning player manages to create a pung or kung meld of their specific seat wind, they will gain an additional faan. After a game is completed, the next person going counter-clockwise rolls the dice for the next game, and the seat winds change accordingly. In addition to seat winds, there is also a round wind, which each round consisting of a minimum of 4 games until the dice has gone all the way around the table and the first East player becomes East again. The first round wind is always East as well, and will change to South, West, then North as rounds are completed. Similar to seat winds, creating a pung or kung meld of the round wind will also award an additional faan.
                    </p>
                    <h5 class="col">Drawing Tiles</h5>
                    <p class="col-sm-9">
                        After the three die have been rolled, the total of the rolls are added up. The walls are then counted <b>counter-clockwise</b> starting with the dice roller. For example, if the rolls added up to 3, the count would land on the player or wall directly opposite the roller, since the roller is 1, the player to the right is 2, and the opposite player would then be 3. If the rolls add up to 5, the count would land back on the roller in the same fashion and so on. On the wall that the count lands on, tiles on the top row are then counted going <b>clockwise</b> using the same total from the dice roll. The East wind player will then draw the first block of 4 tiles after counting, with the counted tiles being skipped. Going counter-clockwise, each player will likewise draw the next block of 4 tiles, going around the table 3 times until each player has 12 tiles. Then in the same order, each player will draw 1 additional tile to create a starting hand of 13. The East wind player then draws another additional tile since they will be the first to act. At the beginning of each turn, the player will draw from the same end of the wall as the initial draw. 
                    </p>
                    <h5 class="col">Flowers and Seasons</h5>
                    <p class="col-sm-9">
                        If any player has any of the 8 special flower or season tiles in their starting hand, they must reveal it immediately and put it aside. Then, the player must draw a new tile to replace it from the back end of the wall (the side that was skipped when counting for the initial draw). The East player draws their replacement tile first, then the other players going counter-clockwise order. If a player has more than one flower or season, they are to draw that many replacement tiles all at once. The same is done if a player draws a flower or season tile from the wall when they take their turn.
                    </p>
                    <p class="col-sm-9">
                        Flowers and Season tiles also have the potential to grant additional faan to the winning player. There are 4 flower and 4 season tiles, numbered 1 through 4. With the East player as seat number 1, and counting up going counter-clockwise, if the winning player possesses their corresponding numbered flower or season, they will gain an additional faan. Also, if the winning player has no flower or season tiles at all, that will also grant an additional faan.

                    <p class="col-sm-9">
                        The East wind player is the first player to act. Since they drew 1 additional tile at the beginning, they will start by discarding 1 tile from their hand. Players must evaluate their starting hand to determine what type of winning hand to aim for, and discard their less useful tiles accordingly. Play then continues to the next player to the right, or counter-clockwise direction. On each turn, players may either claim the most recently discarded tile or draw 1 tile from the wall, then discard 1 tile from their hand.
                    </p>
                    <h5 class="col">Claiming Discarded Tiles</h5>
                    <p class="col-sm-9">
                        Players may claim discarded tiles at the time it is discarded, but only if that tile would complete a meld for them. The player who claims a discard will then take their turn and discard a tile of their own without drawing from the wall. There are some restrictions to claiming discards, however. Chow melds (straights) completed through discard may only be claimed from the player to the left (the player that goes before them). In this case, turn order is not disrupted. Pung and Kung melds, however, may be claimed by any player at the time of the discard. The claimer then takes their turn by discarding, and any player that would have gone before them is skipped. After claiming a discard, the player must reveal the completed meld by placing the tiles face-up beside them on the table. As previously stated, discards may only be claimed at the time of the discard. Tiles in the discard pile from previous turns can no longer be claimed.
                    </p>
                    <p class="col-sm-9">
                        In the case of Kung melds, since it is a meld of 4 tiles instead of 3, players would not be able to complete a 4-meld hand unless an extra tile is drawn. This is done by drawing a tile from the back end of the wall once a Kung has been melded. If a Kung meld is created naturally through draws, the player must still reveal the meld in order to draw the additional tile.

                        The game ends when either a player is able to complete a winning hand, or there are no more tiles on any walls to draw from, which results in a draw. If the East wind player wins the game, they will remain the East wind for the next game as well and roll the die again. If any other player wins, or the game ends in a draw, the next player to the right becomes East wind for the next round and all the wind seats change accordingly. Note that if the East player does not win, the next East wind seat will always be the player to the right, regardless if that player won or not. Since the East wind player stays as East for winning, round winds may last longer than 4 games since it only changes once the East wind goes all the way around the table.

                    <p class="col-sm-9">
                        A winning hand consists of 4 melds and a pair of any tile. There are 2 exceptions to this general hand structure, which are special hands called Thirteen Orphans and Nine Gates. These hands are extremely rare and are worth the maximum faan if a player is able to complete them. There may also be a set minimum faan that a hand must be worth in order to be able to claim victory. The standard minimum faan is usually 3 faan, but it is up to the players to decide how much the minimum should be. Check out the Scoring Table page for a full list of winning hands and their faan value.

                    <p class="col-sm-9">
                        There is another notable hand that is worth 0 faan by itself. This hand is known as the Chicken Hand and consists of a mix of Pungs and Chows of 2 or more suits. Players are usually unable to claim victory with such a hand as the faan value is too low. Chows and Pungs may be mixed if they are all the same suit, which is a flush. Mixing Chows and Pungs as well as suits results in the Chicken Hand.

                    <h5 class="col">Points and Paying Out</h5>

                        Once the faan value of the winning hand is determined, a points system may be used to determine how much money should be paid out. The exact amount of money that each point is worth is arbitrary and is to be established by the players. If the winning tile was a claimed discard, the discarder pays double the value of the hand, while the other players pay the normal value. If the winning tile was self-drawn from the wall, all players pay double to the winner. See below for a faan to points conversion:
